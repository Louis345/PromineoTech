let age = 14; // e.g.

/**
 * Create a variable called "isTeenager". (Do not use var.)
 * If "age" is greater than 12, but less than 20, "isTeenager" should be true.
 * Otherwise, "isTeenager" should be false.
 * You must use either the logical and (&&) or the logical or (||) to solve this problem.
 * Your answer should still work when "age" is a different value.
