let firstName = "Bill"; // e.g.
let letter = "i"; // e.g.

/**
 * Create a variable called "characterPosition".
 * It should be equal to the first index (position) of "letter" within the string "firstName".
 *
 * @example
 * let firstName = "Bill";
 * let letter = "i"; // e.g.
 * The answer should be 1. (JavaScript starts counting with 0).
 *
 * @example
 * let firstName = "Briana";
 * let letter = "a"; // e.g.
 * The answer should be 3. (JavaScript starts counting with 0).
 *
 * Your answer should still work when "firstName" and "letter" are equal to different values than they are above.
