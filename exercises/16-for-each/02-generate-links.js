let htmlStr = "";
const links = [
  // e.g.
  "http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch04.html",

];

/**
 * You can imagine you are creating a list of reference links at the bottom of a Wikipedia page.
 *
 * Using ".forEach", loop through an array of URLs,
 * create a <a> tag string for each link,
 * and append the <a> tag string to the variable "htmlStr"
 *
 * @example
 * // After you solve this problem, "htmlStr" should equal:
 * <a href="http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch04.html"> 1. http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch04.html</a><a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/">2. https://www.ecma-international.org/</a><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=2weL0iAfrEMC">3. https://books.google.com/books?id=2weL0iAfrEMC</a>
 *
 * HINT: You will need to use the index in the array to solve this problem.
 *
 * Your answer should still work if there are different URLs inside of the "links" array.
