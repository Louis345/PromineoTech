 * This is similar to an older problem.
 * Solve this problem with the ternary operator this time.
 *
 * Create a variable called "isEvenOrOdd". (Do not use var.)
 * If "num" is even, "isEvenOrOdd" should equal the string "even".
 * Otherwise, "isEvenOrOdd" should equal the string "odd".
 * Your answer should still work when "num" is a different value.
